## Getting Started


To get started with Shakti, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Setup Environment**: Install the required dependencies using `npm install` and ensure MongoDB is running locally or use MongoDB Atlas.
3. **Configuration**: Configure the backend by creating a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
   - `MONGO_URI` = your MongoDB connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET` = secret key for JWT authentication
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` = Google OAuth client ID
   - `PORT` = port for backend server (default 5000)
4. **Run the Application**: Start the Shakti backend server with `npm start` and verify that everything is running smoothly.
5. **Frontend Connection**: If using the Flutter frontend, update the base API URL to point to your backend server.
6. **Test APIs**: Use Postman or any API client to test the endpoints like:
   - `/api/auth` for authentication
   - `/api/signup` for 3-step signup
   - `/api/posts` for community posts
   - `/api/messages` for real-time chat

**Note:** Make sure to use strong JWT secrets and a reliable MongoDB connection (Atlas recommended) for production deployment.
